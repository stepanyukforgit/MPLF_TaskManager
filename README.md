This project was created to improve the process of accounting for services provided by company employees. MPLF TaskManager provides nice and simple graphical user interface. There are the following main possibilities:

-creation of a table with tasks which contain such columns as task number, client name, target, have done, stage, time spended, costs, state and deletion;

-addition, editing and deletion tasks from the table;

-storing all information from the table on local disk;

-exporting information from the table to text file.

-exporting information from the table to pdf file.

Though this project is still beign developed, it can already be used in different companies work.
